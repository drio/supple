        <p>Fun, fast and responsive.  I had qualms about how an aluminum race bike would
do on the terrain here in Missoula, but the Gas Mask with the Compass Barlow
Passes were a great combo.  Fun climbing bike that accelerates well.  A little
on the rowdy side on the descent.  No mounts for touring but a great day/event
ride bike.</p>

        <p>This bike was a surprise. Not for everyone, but is stupid fun to ride. Nimble
and maneuverable for the tire size.  No toe overlap even with the big tire and
small size frame.  Steers with more body english from the hips.  Out of the box
a little slow feeling with the Maxxis Chronicles.  Accelerates better with
Terrene Coronados set up tubeless.  Comes to life with the Jones Carbon wheels
and Schwalbe G-Ones.  So good, I may end up buying the demo.</p>

        <p>Ride and chill.  Great smooth riding bike.  Perfect road/gravel endurance bike.
Predictable handling on descents.  Doesn&rsquo;t accelerate very well, but will hold
speed once you get it there. Stock wheels are a little on the heavy side.
Tested with ENVE/Chris King wheelset and the bike came to life.     3.5</p>

        <p>For $600 you get a nice looking bike with a fun riding geometry.  It is
severely bogged down by weight. Handling is interesting.  Front end steering
takes some getting use to.  Narrow arc of stability, then the bike just turns
immediately.  Rear end was actually fun, a little on the #tukt side.  Also
tested with some carbon 650b wheels from Irwin Cycling and the bike was
transformed.  Would love to see it come stock with 650b.  This would take the
harshness off the frame.  Also had alignment problems with the dropouts.  Great
first attempt, but lots of room for improvement.</p>

        <p>Suspension corrected, adjustable rear chainstay length, super fun! If you like
the Midnight Special but want a carbon fork stock, this is a price competitive
option.  Only bummer is the lack of mounts on the fork.  Also, some issues with
heel strike on the rear chainstay.  I probably wouldn&rsquo;t ever run a suspension
fork, so the Warakin would better suit me.</p>

        <p>The Rove has a fun all-rounder handling that strikes a great balance between
stability and responsiveness.  Ideal for long rides on mixed terrain.  Could
potentially be your only bike as well if you don&rsquo;t need race quickness.  Would
have been awesome if it had mounts on the fork for touring.  Really reminded me
of the handling of the Warbird V3 but with nice supple tires.</p>

        <p>Warbird loses some responsiveness from V3 but has big gains in terms of utility
and tire size. Great endurance gravel bike or light and fast tourer.  Sizing is
also different from V3, and for me seems to run shorter than expected. Think of
it as a Cutthroat Lite.  More responsive than the Cutthroat but takes on its
utility with the three pack and low rider mounts in the front.</p>
