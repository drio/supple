Ride and chill.  Great smooth riding bike.  Perfect road/gravel endurance bike.
Predictable handling on descents.  Doesn't accelerate very well, but will hold
speed once you get it there. Stock wheels are a little on the heavy side.
Tested with ENVE/Chris King wheelset and the bike came to life.  	3.5
