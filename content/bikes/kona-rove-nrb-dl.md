The Rove has a fun all-rounder handling that strikes a great balance between
stability and responsiveness.  Ideal for long rides on mixed terrain.  Could
potentially be your only bike as well if you don't need race quickness.  Would
have been awesome if it had mounts on the fork for touring.  Really reminded me
of the handling of the Warbird V3 but with nice supple tires.
