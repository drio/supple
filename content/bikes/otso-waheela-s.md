Suspension corrected, adjustable rear chainstay length, super fun! If you like
the Midnight Special but want a carbon fork stock, this is a price competitive
option.  Only bummer is the lack of mounts on the fork.  Also, some issues with
heel strike on the rear chainstay.  I probably wouldn't ever run a suspension
fork, so the Warakin would better suit me.
