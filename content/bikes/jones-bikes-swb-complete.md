This bike was a surprise. Not for everyone, but is stupid fun to ride. Nimble
and maneuverable for the tire size.  No toe overlap even with the big tire and
small size frame.  Steers with more body english from the hips.  Out of the box
a little slow feeling with the Maxxis Chronicles.  Accelerates better with
Terrene Coronados set up tubeless.  Comes to life with the Jones Carbon wheels
and Schwalbe G-Ones.  So good, I may end up buying the demo.
