For $600 you get a nice looking bike with a fun riding geometry.  It is
severely bogged down by weight. Handling is interesting.  Front end steering
takes some getting use to.  Narrow arc of stability, then the bike just turns
immediately.  Rear end was actually fun, a little on the #tukt side.  Also
tested with some carbon 650b wheels from Irwin Cycling and the bike was
transformed.  Would love to see it come stock with 650b.  This would take the
harshness off the frame.  Also had alignment problems with the dropouts.  Great
first attempt, but lots of room for improvement.
