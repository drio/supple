Fun, fast and responsive.  I had qualms about how an aluminum race bike would
do on the terrain here in Missoula, but the Gas Mask with the Compass Barlow
Passes were a great combo.  Fun climbing bike that accelerates well.  A little
on the rowdy side on the descent.  No mounts for touring but a great day/event
ride bike.
