Warbird loses some responsiveness from V3 but has big gains in terms of utility
and tire size. Great endurance gravel bike or light and fast tourer.  Sizing is
also different from V3, and for me seems to run shorter than expected. Think of
it as a Cutthroat Lite.  More responsive than the Cutthroat but takes on its
utility with the three pack and low rider mounts in the front.
